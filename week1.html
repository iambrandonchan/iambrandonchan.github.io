         Question 1: What are my expectations of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've heard this class is highly regarded as difficult, and well worthwhile. I expect a lot of studying, and self-learning. I could imagine that the projects will be time consuming, but I'll be looking forward to them, and learning a good deal.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What did you do this past week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            Not a whole lot, just trying to get back into routine of going to school and etc. This past week was syllabus week, so it was pretty easy. I expect that this semester will be pretty busy.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I'm unfamiliar with python, so I will need to brush up and learn some of the basics. I've got another class that uses python, so it's critical that I look over some of the material. This first project is in python, so it will be a good learning experience.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 4: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            As far as school goes, I need to read some of the assigned readings for my classes, including this one (and also not get behind in school). I still need to fix up my resume, and get ready for the spring career fair. I am still looking for an internship, so I will actively be applying next week.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've already taken OOP, so some of the course expectations are not new for me. I think that the quizzes should be fairly similar, so I will be more prepared to take them. 
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 6: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            My tip of the week is to not daudle on things that you need to do, or I guess to not procrastinate. I also think that you should start early to avoid procrastination. Managing your time is proven to lead a more healthier life style.
