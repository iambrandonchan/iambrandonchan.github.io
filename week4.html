         Question 1: What are my expectations of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've heard this class is highly regarded as difficult, and well worthwhile. I expect a lot of studying, and self-learning. I could imagine that the projects will be time consuming, but I'll be looking forward to it.

         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            It was a long week last week. I had a lot on my plate, and spent a lot of time on campus. I ended up watching a lot of Miyazaki films which were really good. I'm pretty tired from the weekend and also the past week, and I am not really looking forward to this next week, I am sure it will be fairly busy.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
           I think what is in my way is that I don't know much about building a website, which is what I learned today when I met up with my team. I need to look into things like Flask. It is however pretty nice having other group members know whawt they're doing, and can explain stuff to you. Also, setting up this website took a long time, and I guess it is not quite in my way anymore.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've got an algorithms homework that I need to tackle. Also, I need to wrap up this website project; I'm sure it will take longer than I am expecting. I need to also work on my Cloud Computing project, and do competitive programming stuff. Man, I've got some much stuff to do, and I really just don't feel like doing it. It's unfortunate that the weather is too cold to do anything fun outside.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I would say my experience of this class is very similar to my last week's blog post about my experience. There's a lot of self learning which is harder than having someone just teach you it, but whatever, no biggie. The goal for me is to not fall behind in this class, these quizzes are pretty easy having already taken OOP.

         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think going to hackathons and programming competitions are good for getting better at programming. They're fun, and you eat for free. It's pretty self-rewarding to finish a bunch of problems and such. But yea, the competitions are good experiences that everyone should try.
