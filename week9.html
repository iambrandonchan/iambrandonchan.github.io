         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            I worked really hard on some projects for class, just the same as last week. Last week was pretty difficult, my group for my OS class was not really that good, I think I mainly carried our team. I ended up going out to celebrate this weekend for Halloween.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
         I think laziness is in the way for me. I need to start being waaay more proactive with finding an internship. Last year, I was able to land an internship during the spring, but I really need to start applying myself more to this, no pun intended.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I am going to start applying to more internships. I think I will try to apply to an internship everyday; I really want one this summer, and the more I think about it and see other people getting internships, the more I want to find one.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
         I want to learn more inheritance stuff for C++. Learning about constructors wwas really informative, I also want to learn some of the fine grained special things about C++. The Darwin project seems pretty fun, it reminds me of an earlier project I did for CS 312.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            My tip of the week is to not daudle on things that you need to do, or I guess to not procrastinate. I also think that you should start early to avoid procrastination. Managing your time is proven to lead a more healthier life style.
