         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            I had a pretty busy week last week unfortunately. What really sucked was that the SWE project was due at the time I had intramural ultimate, so that was coincidentally unfortunate. I think I had a algo test aswell (can't remember?), and also a cloud computing project due during the week. All in all, a lot more work than I really care for.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
         I think what's in my way is apathy. This is the time during the semester where I become progressively apathetic, which is not good. I find myself arriving later and later to SWE, and deciding to skip other classes completely. The end of the semester I always tend to not put in the same amount of effort as I did during the beginning of the semester. Apathy is kinda a hard thing to change or break.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I want to play intramural frisbee this week, since it got cancelled the other week, and last week I had stuff to do. There's not a whole lot of work for me to due this week, so I might just goof off and not start of work. I hate work.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I would say my experience of this class is very similar to my last week's blog post about my experience. There's a lot of self learning which is harder than having someone just teach you it, but whatever, no biggie. The goal for me is to not fall behind in this class, these quizzes are pretty easy having already taken OOP. Yea, I don't have much to say in this question of my latest awesome weekly blog post.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            My tip of the week is not so much a tip, but a wish/hope. I wish that the gdc had a 3rd computer lab. Sometimes, the lab is too full, and there's not many spaces to sit. Plus, it smells like a mixture of depression, anxiety, chik - fil -a, and coffee. That's not to say that chik-fil-a is a bad thing, I just love some tendies.
