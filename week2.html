         Question 1: What are my expectations of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've heard this class is highly regarded as difficult, and well worthwhile. I expect a lot of studying, and self-learning. I could imagine that the projects will be time consuming, but I'll be looking forward to it.

         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            I spent last week just trying to stay caught up in my classes. I've already set up the collatz project, and spent some time writing unit tests for eval. Other than that, I've spent a good amount of time looking for some clubs, like the EDM club or ACM.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
            Frankly, this week is in mine way. It's that time of the semester where professors start to assign a bunch of assignments/projects. I feel that I am starting to fall behind in all of my classes, and I'm pretty occupied with the collatz project. I want to go to College Station to visit a friend next weekend, but first I need to get through this week.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've got a pretty busy week that I'm not looking forward to one bit. Like everyone else, I'll need to finish up the collatz project, so I'll need to spend some time of that. Also, career fair is coming up, so I need to finalize my resume, and print a bunch of copies.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            This class is pretty cool so far. Walking through the code is pretty helpful, and those quizzes are a little rough. I've got a bad feeling that Professor Downing is going to call me during class when I'm zoning out.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think planning your code before you write it is something that I always forget to do. Also, I think it's good to revist previous written code as well. I think you can learn a lot by revisting code, because most of the time you can evaluate yourself on its quality.
