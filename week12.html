         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
         I mainly just worked on my OS virtual memory project. It's ridiculously difficult to say the least. I missed out on Friday's class for a phone interview, and I had to cancel some plans I had made for my friends birthday, which I feel bad for flaking.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
         I haven't played sports in a long time, and it feels like I haven't done anything fun aswell in a while. It felt great this Saturday, but I unfortunately spent the day indoors working on school. Also, this Monday is in the way, I am pretty hungry for some good turkey and stuffing and gravy and mashed potatoes and etc.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
         I think I plan on eating lots of turkey. My older brother is flying in aswell, so I have to pick him up at the airport. I'll probably try to spend some time with him, as I don't see him very often
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
         Probably the same as last week's blog. Just getting my ass kicked on some quizzes, understanding the lecture until the last 10 minutes, just the usual.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            My tip of the week is to compile code very frequently. I feel that you can catch and fix bugs(obviously) as soon as you write the code, but if you write a large portion of the code, and then compile, it might take more time to debug. This could prove to be cumbersome if you haven't looked at the code you written in a while.
