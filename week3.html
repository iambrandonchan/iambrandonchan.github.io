         Question 1: What are my expectations of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've heard this class is highly regarded as difficult, and well worthwhile. I expect a lot of studying, and self-learning. I could imagine that the projects will be time consuming, but I'll be looking forward to it.

         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            I had a very busy week last week. On top of finishing Collatz, I went to two career fair expos. They went very well; I went to a follow-up interview on Friday, which also went quite well. All in all, last week was tough on me.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
           On the subject of careers, I feel that I'm very week on basic data structures, and technical interview questions. I really want to brush up on those, and get better at thinking fast. I think I might try competitive programming, I wonder if that'd help. 
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I have a cs439 probject due at the end of the week, so I will divert a lot of time and effort towards that. I want to brush up on data structures as well, and get very good at solving problems with them. In addition, I need to write some thank you follow up emails for the companies that I talked to at the career fair.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            Very good! Last lecture on Friday, I enjoyed reviewing common data structures in C++. I hope the next project will revolve around them, for I need practice in that subject/field.  
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            If I had to give some general advice, make a To-Do list everyday. It helps me keep track of the goals/stuff I need to accomplish for the day. And if I don't complete all of the tasks in the To-Do list, I move them over to the next day so I don't forget them.
