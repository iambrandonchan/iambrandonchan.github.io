         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            I applied to a few places, and did some hacker rank tests. The tests were pretty bad, I thought they were kinda hard. I need to practice on the fly programming. I also registered for classes, and am excited for taking software engineering.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
         I am really bad at hacker rank questions for company tests. I need to get better at quick thinking, and interview questions. I want to practice some of the hacker rank questions, or like some questions for cracking the coding interview.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think I will apply to a few jobs here and there. I have a test for 439, so I need to study a bunch this weekened and the coming days. Also, the Darwin project is due next week, and me and my partner haven't done too much, so we will need to crack down on it. Overrall, pretty busy week ahead.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I don't think my experience of this class has changed much. I'm pretty tired of taking quizzes, but that's kind of how my semester is going right now. I'm tired of this semester and want to be done. I'm pretty happy about this class, but there are some hard subjects to understand like double &.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think practicing interview questions is my pick of the week. I think that there aren't many classes that teach you how to think on the spot, and that's what I need to work at. I think programming competitions and hacker rank stuff would be pretty could to brush up on.
