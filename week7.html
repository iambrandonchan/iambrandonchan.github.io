         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            Last week I studied pretty hard for the test on Thursday, and I worked a project for cs439.
            Last week's weather is really nice, and I really wanted to go hiking, but I ended up working on school.
            Man, but that test was close, I almost thought I was gonna do bad on that HackerRank portion.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
           These quizzes are weighing me down. I feel that sometimes even if I prepare, I still do bad. 
           Making an A is my classes seem to be becoming out of reach.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            Same ol' same ol'. I'll probably try to get real far in my 439 project, and also try to hit the gym every
            other day. I've made some good progress on personal fitness, so I'm really happy about that. Also, I
            want to get started early with this next upcoming project.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            That test was tough. The multiple choice kinda got me, I ended up missing 5 questions which is not too bad. 
            However, I was super clutch on the HackerRank portion, and ended up getting my code to work. I think I did
            maybe average on the test, but I not really content with that. Also, I think I finally understand all the 
            concepts we went over in class, so I'm really satisfied.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I believe one of the things that I forget is to focus on myself. I think there are a lot of people who compare
            themselves to others, on achievements, job offers, academics, etc. I think its good to compare yourself 
            to others, although I feel that some people get caught up with that, and forget to focus on themselves. 
            So I think my advice to others would be to just focus on self improvement, and to not contrast yourself 
            harshly with other people.
