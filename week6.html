         Question 1: What are my expectations of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've heard this class is highly regarded as difficult, and well worthwhile. I expect a lot of studying, and self-learning. I could imagine that the projects will be time consuming, but I'll be looking forward to it.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            I killed it on my 439 project, but it took a long time to do. It was a real stressful project, I think my group and I dropped 40+ ish hours working on it, and I think I'm pretty sick of the GDC lab. This next week should be a lot better.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
           I still haven't been able to apply to places, I've been really busy this past week. I even forgot to write up a blog this past week. Also, the material for this class is confusing. There's so much content that I don't understand.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I plan on studying for this upcoming test, and also getting a head start on my 439 project. I need to go over all the notes for this class, and just stay busy, stay working. I think I might also get back into the routine of working out, I skipped a couple days last week.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            This class is tough. It's inciteful(I feel like I'm saying the same thing every blog). I think with every class, I start to zone out or get lost in professor Downing's explainations at the end of class. I will need to go to office hours and get an explanation of... a bunch of things.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think going to hackathons and programming competitions are good for getting better at programming. I've been really meaning to go to these competitions, but the last 2 times I've had an OS project due the night of. But yea, the competitions are good experiences that everyone should try.
