         Pros
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think one of the things I appreciated about this class is that Professor Downing emphasized important points to take away from this class, such as pre/post increment concepts, passing exceptions by reference, pointers, and const values. The lectures are clear, and informative, and I've learned a bunch of things about C++ and Object-Oriented-Design that I think are applicable to enhancing my career. I felt that the quizzes were.. sometimes fair and sometimes unfair. Some quizzes can be straightforward, and some can be kinda confusing; I think it would be more fair if you can revist answer questions, or skip ahead in questions. I thought the projects were pretty good; I don't think I have much to say on it. Also, the tech talks were good, because it gives you an opportunity to apply and also extra credit.

         <strong> 
         Cons
         </strong>
         <p>
         I don't have much to say about cons, or atleast I can't think of any off the spot. On the midterm, I felt some of the multiple choice questions were somewhat... picky, or obscure questions that I felt didn't capture the general content. Also, at the beginning of the semester, Professor Downing had some quizzes pertaining to articles to read, and while throughout the semester there were new articles to read, there weren't any quizzes over the articles. While this is not bad, it's a little inconsistent, just an observation. I think another con would be you have to get used to some of the tools that are required for projects. On second thought, it isn't much of a con, it's more or less annoying I think.

            I would highly recommend this class. You learn a good deal about pointers, and OOP design, and a lot of good mechanics that C++ offers. Before this, I preferred Java of my programming languages. Now, I must say I find C++ more preferable in some ways, and I appreciate C++ a lot more. I don't think I have many negative things to say about this class. I think every CS student should consider taking this class, it has been invaluable to me, and I'm sure it could be invaluable to others.
