         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            Last week I just worked on some projects for other classes and the project for this class. Pretty salty that UT football lost in overtime, however I'm not too upset. I definitely should have spent more time working last week in hindsight. I finally went to a programming competition, and that was cool.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
         Nothing is in my way. At least I don't think at the moment. I don't really see any problems at the moment, other than school being hard. But I mean, the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, no?
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            Just the usual, work on projects. I also need to check back with HackTX, I got put on the waitlist, but I registered the day registration opened. I'm pretty surprised that it filled up quickly, I've never done HackTX.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
         This Allocator project is pretty challenging, but I think that there are parts in the project that I find unclear, or confusing. Other than that, my experience hasn't changed since the last couple weeks, it has been good.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think for me, it is definitely to stay focused at this point of the semester. I think a good amount of people, including me, start to not give a damn about school during the later half of semesters.
