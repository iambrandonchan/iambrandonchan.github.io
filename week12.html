         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
         I successfully did not do the things I was supposed to try to get done last week. Although, that is not to say last week was uneventful. I had the pleasure of eating some tiki chicken masala at the clay pit which was delicious. And my intramural frisbee team and I won our game 15-1, what a beat down!

         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
            Not really sure what's in my way. I really need to finish this blog at the moment, I always seem to forget about writing the blog. Other than that, I don't really have much in my way. 
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
         This week is fairly busy for me. I have a couple projects, one of them being IMDB 4, and another is my cloud computing project. The cloud computing assignmnet shouldn't take me very long to do. IMDB 4 is... well that takes an undetermined amount of time; one of the things I need to figure out is how to dynamically put up a twitter feed. I found a nice library that does that conveniently.

         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
         I would say my experience of this class is very similar to my last week's blog post about my experience. There's a lot of self learning which is harder than having someone just teach you it, but whatever, no biggie. The goal for me is to not fall behind in this class, these quizzes are pretty easy having already taken OOP. Yea, I don't have much to say in this question of my latest awesome weekly blog post.

         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            My tip of the week is to compile code very frequently. I feel that you can catch and fix bugs(obviously) as soon as you write the code, but if you write a large portion of the code, and then compile, it might take more time to debug. This could prove to be cumbersome if you haven't looked at the code you written in a while.
