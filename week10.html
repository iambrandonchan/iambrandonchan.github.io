         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            Last week was my birthday, so I went out this weekend. Very unproductive weekend, which sucks cause I have a test I should be studying for in an hour, and a couple time consuming projects due this week. But it was totally worth! I got an electric shaver which is pretty handy, I'm not a fan of shaving with a manual razor. I also got a couple shirts too to boot.

         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
         What's in my way is that I am starting to become pretty lazy. It's that time of the semester when I stop giving a damn about school. My work ethic is drastically declining, but I don't know, I am feeling quite apathetic these days, which is not a good thing.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            Next week I want to go hiking, or go out, or do something. This week is gonna be pretty trash, so I kinda want to go do stuff. I kinda want to play video games, and not want to critically think. I wish I could just do nothing or not have to work, I wish I could just be a NEET.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I would say my experience of this class is very similar to my last week's blog post about my experience. There's a lot of self learning which is harder than having someone just teach you it, but whatever, no biggie. The goal for me is to not fall behind in this class, these quizzes are pretty easy having already taken OOP. Yea, I don't have much to say in this question of my latest awesome weekly blog post.

         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think practicing interview questions is my pick of the week. I think that there aren't many classes that teach you how to think on the spot, and that's what I need to work at. I think programming competitions and hacker rank stuff would be pretty could to brush up on.
