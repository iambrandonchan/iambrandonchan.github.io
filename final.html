         What did you like the least about the class?

         <p>
            Probably the quizzes. They're kinda monotonous, but I understand the necessity for them. I guess I found them annoying.

            There is a lot of freedom, to which I enjoyed. You can choose the topics or themes of what you want to build, and how it looks, and design. Of course, there are limitations, but I still found the freedom to do a bunch of stuff not required.

         Probably the quizzes, you should be able to go back through questions.

         Pros
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think one of the things I appreciated about this class is that you get a taste of a lot of good skills used professionally, such as sql, javascript, python, and a bunch of other commonly used tools. The lectures are clear, and informative, and I've learned a bunch of core concepts of python and js, to which I value as applicable to my career. I felt that the quizzes were.. sometimes fair and sometimes unfair. Some quizzes can be straightforward, and some can be kinda confusing; I think it would be more fair if you can revist answer questions, or skip ahead in questions. I think the most significant thing I learned is how to set up a web app. I found Katalon to be an extremely invaluable tool, as it automated creating Selenium tests.

         <strong> 
         Cons
         </strong>
         <p>
         I don't have much to say about cons, or atleast I can't think of any off the spot. On the midterm, I felt that the questions were fair. Also, at the beginning of the semester, Professor Downing had some quizzes pertaining to articles to read, and while throughout the semester there were new articles to read, there weren't any quizzes over the articles. While this is not bad, it's a little inconsistent, just an observation. I think another con would be that there is a lot of self-learning of the libraries and tools needed to do the projects. However, you can take this as a pro, cause I feel that self-learning is by far a valuable thing to practice. I didn't really spend a whole lot of time reading, to be exact, 0 hours. I felt that the reading material was not necessary at all.

         Overall thoughts
         </strong>
         <p>
            I would highly recommend this class. You learn a good deal about some languages, and a bunch of very applicable tools. Even though there might be a lot of self-learning(which is a good thing), this class was very much well worth my time. Professor Downing definitely teaches this class very well. I probably wrote a good chunk of code, can't say exactly, who's keeping count?
