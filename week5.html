         Question 1: What are my expectations of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've heard this class is highly regarded as difficult, and well worthwhile. I expect a lot of studying, and self-learning. I could imagine that the projects will be time consuming, but I'll be looking forward to it.

         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            This weekend I had an all-american weekend and exercised my second amendment rights. I went to a shooting range for the first time, and shot a couple guns, which was cool, but also kinda scary; guns are not my thing. It was a treat for myself, for this week was pretty busy unfortunately. A lot of work was done for sure. I wish I hadn't taken so many CS courses, I really shot myself in the foot
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
           I think what is in my way is that I don't know much about building a website, which is what I learned today when I met up with my team. I need to look into things like Flask. It is however pretty nice having other group members know whawt they're doing, and can explain stuff to you. Also, setting up this website took a long time, and I guess it is not quite in my way anymore. I need to learn some React.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            Next week I need to go to the career fair. I also have an algorithms test on monday, god forbid/help us all. I haven't really started studying, as I write this blog I am procrastinating, but hey I'm still being productive, am I right or am I right? The goal for me next week is to just not fall behind on school and such. I need to keep up with my studies or else.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I would say my experience of this class is very similar to my last week's blog post about my experience. There's a lot of self learning which is harder than having someone just teach you it, but whatever, no biggie. The goal for me is to not fall behind in this class, these quizzes are pretty easy having already taken OOP. Yea, I don't have much to say in this question of my latest awesome weekly blog post.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think for me, it is definitely to stay focused at this point of the semester. I think a good amount of people, including me, start to not give a damn about school during the later half of semesters. So my tip of the week would be to remember to have the same determination/drive as in the beginning of the semester.
