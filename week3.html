         Question 1: What are my expectations of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've heard this class is highly regarded as difficult, and well worthwhile. I expect a lot of studying, and self-learning. I could imagine that the projects will be time consuming, but I'll be looking forward to it.

         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            This past week was fairly busy. My algorithms homework took a little longer than I had hoped, learning the LaTeX editor took a lot longer than I cared for. The Collatz project wasn't too bad, I mainly just scrapped up what I had to do to meet the requirements for the little things, like formatting, commenting, and testing. My Cloud Computing project took very little time, so I was pretty pleased with getting it done very early!
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
           I still need to fix up my resume. It's mostly done, but I'm debating whether or not to include my school project, PintOS. I don't want my resume to overflow a single page, but at the same time, I kinda want to include my PintOS project; I feel like that's a relevant and interesting project to put on a resume.

         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            Well, I successfully did nothing this weekend, which was the opposite of what I intended. I need to do a bunch of problems for algorithms, solve my competitive programming challenges, and meet up with my SWE group to discuss ideas for our next project. I really want to play frisbee or do something outdoors this week, so we'll see. I think I will go stop by Downing's office and say hello and talk with him during the week?
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I was very happy learning of the types of variables that Python offers. I think that's what I like about this course, how Downing teaches the mechanics of programming languages. Also, the way Downing explains these mechanics is pretty clear, and very easy to catch on.

         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            If you have stuff/school work to do, don't go out on a Saturday night, don't play video games, and don't do shenanigans. It happens to me all the time, I'm pretty hypocritical. I guess don't be hypocritical, it's pretty ironic. This pick-of-the-week is ironic..?
