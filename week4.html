         Question 1: What are my expectations of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've heard this class is highly regarded as difficult, and well worthwhile. I expect a lot of studying, and self-learning. I could imagine that the projects will be time consuming, but I'll be looking forward to it.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            It was a tough week last week; I worked on my first project for CS439 most of the time. I think I spent around 25 hours for that first project, and I'm not too excited to start the second project for CS439. On top of that, I hadn't started the Voting project until today, so I'm very behind in school.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
           I think that I'm very weak in technical interview questions, I need to work on data structure questions. However, school takes a lot of my time, and I want to do other things like go out, hiking, and etc.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I need to finish the Voting project, like everyone else. And then I need to learn pintos for CS439, and also apply to more jobs and do an interview. I also want to hit the gym since I missed out a bunch last week because of allergies. However, I will start the week with watching the Dallas Cowboys play the Arizona Cardinals.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            This class is getting hard. Starting Voting from scratch is pretty rough; I'm confused on how to do the makefile, I think I literally copied the Collatz makefile and replaced all instances of "collatz" with "voting". And these left/right variables are... confusing?
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think planning your code before you write it is something that I always forget to do. Also, I think it's good to revist previous written code as well. I think you can learn a lot by revisting code, because most of the time you can evaluate yourself on its quality.
