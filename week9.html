         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            Last week kinda sucked, not gonna lie. I spent a lot of time working on an algorithms assignment, the swe project, and also the cloud computing project. That cloud computing project took a lot longer than I expected/hoped, and the SWE project was kinda rough, there's a lot to do. And yea, algo is algo. This semester is such trash. The good news is I finally got an internship, and just when I was starting to go broke again.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
         I think I am starting to get tired of school. I want to hurry up this semester, even though it's gone by fast. Doing school is too much frustration/stress, it can be kinda depressing sometimes. I want some free time, and I want to do fun stuff. 
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I really want to get a good amount of work done, even though I don't have any due dates coming up. I've got a lot of stuff/due dates the following next week, like an algorithms test, a SWE project, and a cloud computing project. So, I kinda wanna preemptively get some stuff done that way I won't have as much to do during the weekend, cause I kinda wanna go out cause it'll be my birthday.

         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
         I would say my experience of this class is very similar to my last week's blog post about my experience. There's a lot of self learning which is harder than having someone just teach you it, but whatever, no biggie. The goal for me is to not fall behind in this class, these quizzes are pretty easy having already taken OOP. Yea, I don't have much to say in this question of my latest awesome weekly blog post.

         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            My tip of the week is to eat your veggies and fruits. Eating healthy is good for you, and leads to a healthy life style. Also, do exercise. Exercising is also very good for you, and leads to a healthy life style. Another life pro tip would be to go outside and enjoy being in the sun.
