         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            Last week I was a pretty busy/crappy week. I had a test that was kinda difficult, which I didn't prepare near as well as I should have. I also had a couple interviews, and an assignment due. It was a long week to say the least.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
         Nothing is in my way. At least I don't think at the moment. I don't really see any problems at the moment, other than school being hard. But I mean, the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, no?
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I have another interview on Tuesday, and an assessment some other day that I can quite remember off the top of my head. I want to do a couple days of SXSW, and I also really want to go hiking/camping because the weather is supposed to be gorgeous this week, so I'm really looking forward to that. I also need to do some of the SWE project.

         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
         I would say my experience of this class is very similar to my last week's blog post about my experience. There's a lot of self learning which is harder than having someone just teach you it, but whatever, no biggie. The goal for me is to not fall behind in this class, these quizzes are pretty easy having already taken OOP. Yea, I don't have much to say in this question of my latest awesome weekly blog post.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            My tip of the week is to compile code very frequently. I feel that you can catch and fix bugs(obviously) as soon as you write the code, but if you write a large portion of the code, and then compile, it might take more time to debug. This could prove to be cumbersome if you haven't looked at the code you written in a while.
