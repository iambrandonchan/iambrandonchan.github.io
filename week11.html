         <strong> 
         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            I took a really hard test for operating systems on Wednesday. I think I might have been pretty close to failing, but I think I did pretty close to average. I also finished doing Darwin, and ended up turning it in close to the deadline.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
         This semester is in my way. I'm pretty tired of school, and especially this is the time in the semester when I start to slack off and not do a good job at my school work. I'm pretty ready for this winter break for sure.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I have this project for operating systems called virtual memory, where you implement paging in a toy operating system. It's pretty hard, and I haven't really gotten much done, because of last week's test and the Darwin project. I think I might go hiking, because it feels pretty good outside, especially the last few days. I think I might have some hot cheetos for the week.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I'd say the same as last weeks blog, along with the past 7 weeks. I mean, I definitely think this class is pretty practical. I think it it's weird that the stuff we learn in class is kind of loosely related to the projects.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think personal health is my tip of the week. Exercising or eat healthy results in a healthier person. Also, brushing your teeth and flossing is a plus too.
