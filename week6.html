         Question 1: What are my expectations of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've heard this class is highly regarded as difficult, and well worthwhile. I expect a lot of studying, and self-learning. I could imagine that the projects will be time consuming, but I'll be looking forward to it.

         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            It was unexpectingly national margarita day this week, so I was dragged into Trudy's happy hour. It was quite the night, I'm not too big of a fan of margs, definitely not my cup of tea/glass of wine, however, I didn't pay tab, fortunately(record breaking 50 margs). This was the peak of my week (thus far). The pit of my week was... an algorithms test which I didn't think was too shabby(I thought people overhyped it), and career fair, which I felt like I made a fair impression.

         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
           I think school. It's starting to get a little annoying. That and I have no clue where I'm living next year. I was really considering studying abroad, that way I don't have to go through the trouble of finding a place. However, I think inorder to study internationally would be a lot of paper work which is not my thing.

         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            Next week I will work on... school? I need to send some thank you/follow ups to some of the jobs I applied for/apply for more jobs. I'm probably gonna get some R&R this weekend, I don't really feel like doing anything.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I would say my experience of this class is very similar to my last week's blog post about my experience. There's a lot of self learning which is harder than having someone just teach you it, but whatever, no biggie. The goal for me is to not fall behind in this class, these quizzes are pretty easy having already taken OOP. Yea, I don't have much to say in this question of my latest awesome weekly blog post.

         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            Brushing your teeth twice a day keeps the doctor away. The same could be said with eating apples. I think what I am trying to say is to take care of yourself. Try looking at a food pyramid to get the max nutrients you need for a day. A balanced meal is very underrated.
