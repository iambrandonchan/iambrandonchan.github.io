         <strong> 
         Question 1: What are my expectations of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've heard this class is highly regarded as difficult, and well worthwhile. I expect a lot of studying, and self-learning. I could imagine that the projects will be time consuming, but I'll be looking forward to it.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 2: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            Not a whole lot. I fixed up my resume to reflect my internship this summer. I've been working on a command line tool that automates commands, and a single-paged web app for my portfolio.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I'm unfamiliar with the syntax of C++, let alone C in general. I'm also not very good with pointers. I'll be taking this class, CS371P,  along with CS439, so I believe that this semester will be pretty difficult. However, I'm confident that I will be able to manage both classes.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 4: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            As far as school goes, I need to read some of the assigned readings for my classes, including this one (and also not get behind in school). I still need to fix up a small part of my resume, and my web app. Other than that, just follow my To-Do list. Actually, I'm having trouble at the moment using JS and AngularJS in my html for this blog page, so I need to look into that some more.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            This week, I felt that this class is not your typical, powerpoint, cookie cutter class. It was interesting learning some software tools the past couple days, I wish that I could have more of a demonstration, but I understand time constraints for this class can limit demonstrations.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 6: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I didn't realize that GitHub can host web apps for people. I'm trying to make it dynamic with AngularJS, however I can't figure out why I get errors. Other than that, Docker sounded like a cool resource to use, I plan on checking it out.
