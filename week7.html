         Question 1: What did you do this past week??
         </strong>
         <p>
            I ended up studying for the test in this class, which was not too bad. I thought it went well for the amount of studying I did, so I'm pretty content. I don't think I did very well in academics this past week, just did kinda bad in algorithms, forgot to turn in my competitive programming assignments. Kinda a rough week, but its spring break coming up soon, so I just need to get through this coming week.

         <strong> 
         Question 2: What's in my way?
         </strong>
         <p>
           Same ol' same ol'. Still need to find a job for this coming summer, and also a place to live next year. I should think/try harder to do these, but I'm too lazy, so whatever. This semester is hard enough as it is, and I don't want to sacrifice my free time and time devoted to school.
         </p>
         <br>
         <strong> 
         Question 3: What will I do next week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I've got a cloud computing test coming up that I need to hop to on studying for. I need to also complete my alogrithms homework, but I got a good portion of that done this weekend, so I'm fairly happy. Although, I still need to go back and review it to make sure it makes sense, etc. I also have a couple phone interviews coming up which shouldn't be hard, just HR stuff.
         </p>

         <strong> 
         Question 4: What's my experience of the class?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I would say my experience of this class is very similar to my last week's blog post about my experience. There's a lot of self learning which is harder than having someone just teach you it, but whatever, no biggie. The goal for me is to not fall behind in this class, these quizzes are pretty easy having already taken OOP. Yea, I don't have much to say in this question of my latest awesome weekly blog post.

         <strong> 
         Question 5: What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
         </strong>
         <p>
            I think practicing interview questions is my pick of the week. I think that there aren't many classes that teach you how to think on the spot, and that's what I need to work at. I think programming competitions and hacker rank stuff would be pretty could to brush up on.
